### What I learned

In the process of manipulating the image, i learnt how to size images responsively using max-width. I also discovered new properties like object-fit even if i didn't use them in this particular project

### Continued development

i stumbled on min(), max() and clamp(), and these are some properties i don't really understand. Also, i don't have a full grasp of the the tasks you can achieve when using properties that involve max and min. E.g min-width, min-vh, e.t.c. These are all areas i would like to learn and improve on.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource ](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_responsive.asp) - This helped me understand responsive images. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
